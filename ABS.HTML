      <h2>Happenings in ABS</h2>
      <h3>●→  Self Defence</h3>
      <img src="ABS3.jpg" alt="Photo 2">
      <p> Allenhouse Business School, Rooma , Kanpur, conducted a ‘Self defence’ session on October 15, 2019, under the “Fit India Campaign”for teaching students the importance of self defence in our life. It is rightly said, “Training for self defense is not a cost….. It’s rather an investment.”</p>
      <p>Fitness is far more than simply exercising on a regular basis. Fitness, as a term, is contextual. It could be described as “being fit for taking on challenges set in front of you”. One should always be mentally fit and physically fit as well. Just like fitness, self defense is equally important for women as well as men. Self-defence is a risk reduction strategy that offers training and education on how to face dangerous situations. The aim is to make students aware about the various techniques of self defense and motivate them to take suitable steps to defend themselves. Mr. Vibhor Verma(National Refree, Black Belt, National Gold Medalist)and a student of BBA 2ndyear (batch 2018-21), guided students of BCA 2nd year.</p>
